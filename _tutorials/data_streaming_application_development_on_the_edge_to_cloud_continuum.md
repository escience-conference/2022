title: "Data Streaming Application Development on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum"
schedule: "October, 2022"
---

Stream processing allows applications to process data directly as it is produced or received. Although the generated data provides great potential, deploying stream processing applications solely in the cloud puts a stress on network links and storage systems of sensors and scientific instruments, preventing applications from reacting to events in a timely manner.

The tutorial addresses the development of data streaming applications across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. We focus on data-driven workflows that use distributed data sources to aid in important decision-making and scientific applications. During this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating data streaming applications using the [R-Pulsar library](http://rpulsar.org/). We'll go over how to use R-Pulsar to program and deploy data analytics that span the edge and the cloud. We'll start with some fundamental concepts for managing runtime events based on data content and resource availability. The tutorial will then focus on how a developer can specify reactive actions and tradeoffs for cost- and quality-oriented runtime policies.

This tutorial's programming activities are carried out with R-Pulsar, utilizing scientific data as well as data processing tools. The tutorial will be delivered by the presenter, but participants will also be able to deliver it live.
