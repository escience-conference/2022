description: 
  'IEEE eScience 2022 brings together leading interdisciplinary research communities, developers and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms and tools with a strong focus on practical solutions and challenges. eScience 2022 interprets eScience in its broadest meaning that enables and improves innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all domain sciences ranging from traditional areas in physics and earth sciences to more recent fields such as social sciences, arts and humanities, and artificial intelligence for a wide variety of target architectures including HPC, cloud and IoT infrastructures. <br/><br/> The 18th IEEE International Conference on e-Science is co-located with the <a href="https://www.theglobalresearchplatform.net/meetings/3rd-global-research-platform-workshop-2022/">3rd GRP Workshop (3GRP)</a>. Both audiences share common interests, content, and culture. Co-location provides attendees with the option to register for both events. '
