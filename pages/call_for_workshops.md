# Call for Workshops

The 18th IEEE eScience Conference will be held in Salt Lake City on October 11-14, 2022. eScience 2022 welcomes proposals for workshops to be held with the main conference on Tuesday, October 11, 2022.

The eScience conference has a long history of hosting broad and well-attended workshops broadly related to eScience and co-located with the main conference. These workshops share the goal of bringing together international and interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies.
 
Workshops play a crucial role in the conference by providing an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their work in a more focused way than the conference itself, and to have in-depth discussions of particular topics of interest to the community. Workshops may be focused on any eScience-related topic including, but not limited to, interdisciplinary research, advanced cyberinfrastructure, data science, and education. 
 
eScience 2022  invites authors of workshop proposals to consider a diverse group of organizers, paper reviewers, and keynote speakers in terms of race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic areas.
 
eScience 2022 accepts two types of workshop proposals: 1) workshops with peer-reviewed papers and proceedings, and 2) workshops with invited talks and no proceedings.
 
## Workshops with peer-reviewed papers and proceedings:
 
Workshop organizers are responsible for establishing a program committee, paper submission system, collecting and evaluating submissions, notifying authors of acceptance or rejection in due time, ensuring a transparent and fair selection process, organizing selected papers into sessions, and assigning session chairs. Proposals showing clear focus and objectives in areas of emerging or developing interest will be prioritized.
 
The proceedings of the workshops will be included in the eScience 2022 proceedings to be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, USA and made available online through the IEEE Digital Library if the following criteria will be followed:
- The solicitation for papers must be open.
- All the papers must be peer-reviewed by a qualified Program Committee.
- The workshops Program Committee must have an appropriate size for the expected number of submissions.
- The workshop proceedings must have at least 4 papers (for a half-day workshop) or 6 papers (for a full-day workshop), at a length of at least 6 pages and no longer than 10 pages (including figure, tables, and citations) in the IEEE conference format.
- For each paper selected for publication, at least one of the authors must be registered to eScience 2022 to present the paper in person.

Workshop proposals should be submitted per email to Coming Soon
