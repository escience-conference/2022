The 18th IEEE eScience Conference will be held in Salt Lake City on **October 11-14, 2022**.

eScience 2022 brings together leading interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all domains ranging from traditional areas in the physical and earth sciences to emerging disciplines such as the social sciences, arts and humanities, and artificial intelligence for a wide variety of target architectures including HPC, cloud, and IoT infrastructures.
 
Science in all domains is becoming increasingly digital – from capturing and analyzing data in large scale experiments and simulations to the exploitation of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Still, many researchers face significant challenges in developing and using e-Infrastructures and associated software and workflows for their problems. Interdisciplinary approaches, combining numerical methods, computer science, and domain science, are needed to tackle these challenges. eScience 2022 provides a forum for researchers and engineers across scientific domains to meet and discuss their challenges and latest developments. Domains include, but are not limited to, life sciences, health research, digital humanities, and social sciences, engineering, physics, chemistry, astronomy, climate science, environmental science, materials science, and geosciences. The conference targets, but is not limited to, the innovative application of digital technologies to research problems, the development of application software, tools, and libraries that enhance the efficiency and capabilities in the scientific process; and the development of e-Infrastructures providing the required hardware capacities and capabilities.
 
This year, the conference is soliciting three types of contributions:

- **Full papers** (10 pages, IEEE format) presenting previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions
- **Posters** (2 pages, IEEE format) to showcase early stage results and innovations
- **Abstracts** (about 300 words) outlining early ideas on a possible research topic or more mature interdisciplinary developments

All submissions will be single-blind and peer-reviewed. Selected abstracts and full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers and 2-page poster papers as well as abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings through the IEEE Digital Library. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster presentation. 
 
## Paper, Poster, and Abstract Submission Guidelines
Authors are invited to submit conference papers (10 pages) for an oral presentation using the IEEE 8.5×11 manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. Templates are available from [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
