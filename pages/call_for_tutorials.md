## Conference Call for Tutorials

We invite proposals for half and full-day tutorials to be held at IEEE eScience 2021 on September 20, 2021. The eScience 2021 Tutorial Program is intended to teach new and/or state-of-the art tools and techniques relevant to the eScience audience, disseminate information to conference attendees on recently emerging topics and trends, or provide surveys and overviews of related digital technologies.
We encourage all submissions that fall in the area of the conference, and particularly those that have a practical (hands-on) component which helps attendees learn the new technologies presented in the tutorial.

eScience2021 is held fully online this year. Tutorials must be conducted fully online. The eScience2021 organizer will provide the online conference tool for the tutorials organizer.

Please send any inquiries to [escience2021-tutorials@ml.riken.jp](mailto:escience2021-tutorials@ml.riken.jp)

eScience 2021 Tutorials Program Co-Chairs: Peter Thoman, University of Innsbruck and Kento Sato, RIKEN R-CCS
